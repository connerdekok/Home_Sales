# Home_Sales

Title- Homework Module 22 Home Sales Challenge- Conner Dekok
In this project we looked at SparkSQL to help determine home sales data when using SparkSQL This helped us create multiple temporary views to view the data.  
Collaboration with other students- I worked with Hunter Becker on this project.  We worked together on completing this project and comparing our results with one another to help make sure we were on the right track when it came to completing this assignment. 
I reviewed the in-class meetings and reviewed the examples we went through in these class lessons. This helped me create some of my starter code along with comments that I used throughout my code. 
I used Microsoft copilot to help correct or ask any questions and bugs I had when creating my code.
